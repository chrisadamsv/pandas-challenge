For use with module 4 homework due 9.16. For this challenge I relied on the material from class in the last week as well as chat gbt.

# Written Analysis

- The overall mean score for both math and reading for the district is similar, at 79% and 81.9%, respectively. A difference of 2.1%. Despite this, the overall student passing rate is more significantly different between math and reading, at 75% and 85.8%, respectively. A difference of 10.8%. The percentage of students who passed both is 65.2%.

- Charter schools have a much higher rate of passing in every category. 
    - Charter schools have passing rates of 93.6% in math, 96.6% in reading, and 90.4% overall. 
    - District schools have passing rates of 66.5% in math, 80.8% in reading, and 53.7% overall. 
    - A 27.1%, 15.8%, and 36.7% difference, respectively. 

- There is a significant difference in passing rate for large schools compared to medium and small schools.
    - Schools with large student bodies have passing rates of 70% in math, 82.8% in reading, and 58.3% overall. 
    - Schools with medium student bodies have passing rates of 93.6% in math, 96.8% in reading, and 90.6% overall. 
    - Schools with small student bodies have passing rates of 93.6% in math, 96.1% in reading, and 89.9% overall. 
    - A 23.6%, 14%, and 32.3% difference, respectively, between large schools and medium schools.

-  Per student spending has little effect on the passing rate. 

# Conclusions

- These findings lead to interesting conclusions:
    - One conclusion is that schools would improve passing rates if they would split large population schools and create new schools. This difference in passing rate between large, and medium and small schools could be due to less individualized attention given to each student when teachers have more heads to manage. 
    - Another conclusion is that investing more into charter schools could improve overall passing rates. This could also be explained by the fact that charter schools tend to have smaller student bodies than district schools.
